| `openio_zookeeper_autopurge_snapRetainCount` | `3` | When enabled, ZooKeeper auto purge feature retains the autopurge.snapRetainCount most recent snapshots and the corresponding transaction logs in the dataDir and dataLogDir respectively and deletes the rest |
| `openio_zookeeper_bind_address` | `openio_bind_address` | The address that this zookeeper instance will run on |
| `openio_zookeeper_bind_interface` | `ansible_default_ipv4.alias` | The interface that this zookeeper instance will run on |
| `openio_zookeeper_bind_port` | `6005` | Listening port |
| `openio_zookeeper_cluster_ports` | `"2888:3888"` | Peers use the former port to connect to other peers |
| `openio_zookeeper_gridinit_dir` | `"/etc/gridinit.d/{{ openio_zookeeper_namespace }}"` | Path to copy the gridinit conf |
| `openio_zookeeper_gridinit_file_prefix` | `""` | Maybe set it to {{ openio_zookeeper_namespace }}- for old gridinit's style |
| `openio_zookeeper_init_limit` | `10` | initLimit is timeouts ZooKeeper uses to limit the length of time the ZooKeeper servers in quorum have to connect to a leader |
| `openio_zookeeper_java_args` | `string` | String of java arguments |
| `openio_zookeeper_log_properties` | `"INFO,ROLLINGFILE"` | The severity level is associated with the root logger with appenders |

| `openio_zookeeper_namespace` | `OPENIO` | Namespace |
| `openio_zookeeper_parallel_gc_threads` | `ansible_processor_vcpus` | Sets the number of threads used during parallel phases of the garbage collectors. The default value varies with the platform on which the JVM is running |
